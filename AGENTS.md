# AGENTS Instructions

## Commit Policy
- After completing requested code changes, run relevant verification (at minimum `git diff` and any lightweight checks applicable to the change).
- If there are modified files for the request, stage only related files and create a commit in the same turn.
- Use a clear, task-scoped commit message.
- If commit is blocked (for example, failing checks or missing user-required info), report the blocker explicitly.
